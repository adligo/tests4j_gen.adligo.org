This is a unfinished project
that was used to autogenerate some 
tests4j classes and will eventually hold 
a gwt trial wrapper generator.

To use it for;
Java Standard Class Reference Group static String interfaces,constant lookup and tests4j trial lines;
run JSEGroupGen, 
feel free to modify the source code for what you need as you probably will
since this is rarely used and NOT tested.  

To use it for;
Full I_ClassAttributes like the gwt_refs.adligo.org project
build a class like GWTGroupGen
and run it.

The java source code which is printed to the console
can be copied and pasted into a .java file with minimal editing
to create a reference group for a I_ReferenceGroup implementation 
of some sort.
